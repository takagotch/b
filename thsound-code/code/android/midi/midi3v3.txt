The 3.3V MIDI gadget has three connectors, as follows:

  * 2 pins - Power supply: VIN (1V - 3.3V), GND (left to right)
  * 3 pins - Stepup voltage converter: GND, VOUT, VIN
  * 4 pins - Bluetooth module: RX, TX, GND, VIN

The attached picture shows the gadget with all components plugged in.

The Bluetooth module is an RN-42 Bluetooth transceiver and the IC is a 6N138 optocoupler. The transistor is a generic PNP transistor. Resistor values are marked in the Fritzing project.
